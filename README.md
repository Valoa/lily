# lily

Lily, will be the water version of the pixi. old pixi files found on https://github.com/HermanKopinga/Buren/

- new hardware is added, to allow the pixi to readout 2 lipo voltage protectors, and controll an 40v powerled
- hardware is made so that it fits under the original pixi using A3 and pin 5 on the pixi pcb
- also the powerled will have small pcb cast in epoxy that wil be partly "water cooled"
